# Mage-OS Website Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic direction, goals, structure, and target audiences for the Mage-OS website. The core principle is a **product-led approach** that positions the Mage-OS Distribution as the primary value proposition while maintaining strong community engagement.

## Strategic Vision

### From Association to Product Focus

The website should shift focus from "who we are as an organization" to "what Mage-OS Distribution can do for you." This aligns with best practices from successful open-source projects that prioritize product value while maintaining community engagement.

### Core Principles

**Product-First Philosophy**
The distribution is the primary value delivery mechanism. The website must communicate:
- What Mage-OS Distribution does
- Why it's better than alternatives
- How to start using it

This information should be accessible before organizational details.

**User Journey Optimization**
Different visitors have different needs:
- Merchants evaluating e-commerce platforms need different information than developers
- Magento users considering migration need specific migration guidance
- Contributors looking to get involved need clear participation pathways

**Documentation as Product**
For technical products, documentation quality directly impacts adoption. Getting-started guides, installation instructions, and migration documentation are product features themselves.
